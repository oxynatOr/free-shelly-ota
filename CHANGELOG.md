All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Profile `HTG3` (Shelly H&T Gen3), hardware-confirmed with `--esphome-factory`.
- Optional profile key `pt_offset` (partition table address, default `0x10000`); `add-device` reads it from the package.
  The H&T Gen3 keeps its table at `0xf000`.

- Optional profile key `boot_min_version`: default for `--boot-min-version` with `--esphome-factory`. `HTG3` sets `1.0.9`:
  the H&T Gen3 installer reports an installed bootloader 1.0.3, so the generic "one patch above the package" (1.0.3) was
  skipped and Shelly's loader stayed. With 1.0.9 the bootloader is written (hardware-confirmed).

### Changed
- README: how to check that the bootloader was really replaced (installer log `Boot: cur ... min ...`, UART boot log) and
  the UART fix.

### Removed
- Profiles `PlugUSG4` and `PlugUSG4ZB` (Plug US Gen4): cannot be tested by the maintainer. `add-device` still creates
  profiles for them. The variant tests now use `PowerStrip` / `PowerStripZB`.

### Fixed
- `--esphome-yaml` check no longer hard-codes the partition table offset 0x10000; it uses the profile's `pt_offset`.
- RPC errors now include the device's answer (e.g. `OTA not allowed (Battery below 30 percent. )`) instead of only the HTTP code.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-04
First release (experimental).

### Added
- `build`, `send`, `restore`, `log`, `fetch`, `add-device`, `inspect`, `list`, `clean`; profiles for 8 Shelly Gen3/Gen4 devices
  (hardware-confirmed: Plug M Gen3 only).
- `--esphome-factory` / `--boot-min-version`: ship ESPHome's bootloader and a clean `otadata` in the package.
- Credential check: `build` compares the image with the ESPHome config and `secrets.yaml`, warns with the names of matches,
  records them in the report; `--secrets FILE`, `--fail-on-secrets`; `send` and `inspect` warn again.
- `ota.py --version`, `tool_version` in the build report.

### Changed
- Help texts and post-flash messages describe the bootloader options and their risk; the follow-up "update the bootloader"
  note and the `allow_partition_access` warning no longer appear when the package already carries ESPHome's bootloader.
- `send` says when it could not check whether the bootloader is replaced (no cached official ZIP).
