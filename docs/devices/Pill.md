Reported: the USB-C port exposes the chip's USB Serial/JTAG, so this device can be flashed and recovered with `esptool` without opening it. That makes UART recovery much easier than on the other models.

| Fact | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Profile | `Pill` |
| Flash | 8 MB |
| Official package | 2.0.1 |
| Partition table | `0x10000` |
| App slot size | `0x280000` |
| Bootloader `min_version` | `1.0.9` (set in the profile) |
| ESPHome device page | [Shelly The Pill](https://devices.esphome.io/devices/shelly-the-pill/) |

## Before you start

Check first:

- [ ] the device runs Shelly's own firmware, not ESPHome yet
- [ ] you know its IP address (`--ip`), or this PC is on the device's own access point (default `192.168.33.1`)
- [ ] the device can reach this PC: same network, port 8000 (`--port`) not blocked
- [ ] your ESPHome config uses the partition table below and is compiled

Also:

- [ ] A USB-C cable and `esptool` are at hand as your way back ([Recovery over UART](../recovery-uart.md)).

## ESPHome config

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `build` refuses a config without Shelly's partition table. Copy `partitions/Pill-stock.csv` from this repository next to your
> YAML and keep `CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET: "0x10000"`.

```yaml
esp32:
  variant: ESP32C3
  board: esp32-c3-devkitm-1
  flash_size: 8MB
  partitions: Pill-stock.csv        # copy from partitions/ in this repository
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
    sdkconfig_options:
      COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_SIZE: y
      CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET: "0x10000"
    advanced:
      enable_ota_rollback: false

ota:
  - platform: esphome
    allow_partition_access: true
```

> [!TIP]
> The [ESPHome device page](https://devices.esphome.io/devices/shelly-the-pill/) has the pins and an example config. Replace its `esp32:` block with the one above, or `build` refuses it.

## Pins

The pins (the three I/O pins of the sensor port, the reset button, the status LED) are on the
[ESPHome device page](https://devices.esphome.io/devices/shelly-the-pill/). USB-C is the flashing path, so no soldering is
needed. The sensor port takes Shelly's add-ons (5-terminal, SSR, analog 0 to 30 V, DS18B20).

## Flash it

1. **Install the requirements** (once):

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Fetch** the official package:

   ```
   python ota.py fetch Pill --insecure
   ```

3. **Build:** put your app into it; the ZIP goes to `out/`:

   ```
   python ota.py build Pill app.ota.bin --esphome-factory app.factory.bin --esphome-yaml app.yaml
   ```

4. **Check the device** first. Nothing is sent:

   ```
   python ota.py send Pill out/Pill-app-<date>.zip --ip <device IP> --dry-run
   ```

5. **Flash it** (the log goes to a file with `--log-file`):

   ```
   python ota.py send Pill out/Pill-app-<date>.zip --ip <device IP> --log-file
   ```

`app.ota.bin` and `app.factory.bin` are the two files ESPHome compiles. `--dry-run` only checks the device and, for this
package, reads the update target slot. Command reference: [Commands](../commands.md).

## What to expect

`send` shows these lines at the default log level, in this order:

| # | Log line | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `Update target slot: 0 ...` | The slot check of `send`. Anything else: run `python ota.py restore Pill` first |
| 2 | `Device: The bootloader will be replaced ...` (raw log: `Boot: cur ... min ... update? 1`) | The installer will write ESPHome's bootloader. `WARNING: ESPHome's bootloader was NOT written` (`update? 0`) means it will not: build again with a higher `--boot-min-version` ([why](../bootloader-and-slots.md#is-the-new-bootloader-really-written-min_version)) |
| 3 | The progress (`Update: ... %`, one line that updates in place) up to 100 %, then `Done: update installed, the device confirmed it` | The device restarts into ESPHome |

## Notes for this device

No device-specific findings yet. Please report the file written by `--log-file`, especially the lines `Update target slot`, `Boot: cur ... update?` and `Will write to slot`.

## Way back

USB-C and `esptool` ([Recovery over UART](../recovery-uart.md): the same steps, with the USB-C port instead of a UART adapter, if the report holds). While Shelly firmware runs: `python ota.py restore Pill`.

> [!WARNING]
> - **Wipes Wi-Fi and settings.** ESPHome opens its own access point or joins the Wi-Fi from your config; if nothing comes up, power-cycle the device ([help](../troubleshooting.md#esphome-does-not-start-after-the-update)).
> - **Flashed it? Tell us,** also when it worked: [open a device report](https://github.com/oxynatOr/free-shelly-ota/issues/new?template=device-report.yml).
